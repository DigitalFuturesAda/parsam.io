    <!-- Book In 3 Sentences Section -->

    <h2>Book in 3 Sentences</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            You don't have to be an expert in a particular role in order to teach. Its better to be an amateur as you
            understand how a beginner thinks, unlike a master who wont really remember how it was being a complete
            newbie.
        </li>
        <li>
            Don't worry too much about the numbers, worry about the quality of people that follow and how much they
            care. Then focus on putting out work of stuff you are doing or have done that would provide value to them.
            Think of it as a way of teaching yourself and looking back on your past mistakes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Since you put out your work on the internet, you come across people who share the same interests or values
            as you. You can connect with them and bounce back information which will benefit you heavily. Might find a
            business partner, future spouse, or even an employer since you SHOWED your work. As human beings we all are
            curious to know a persons process of providing an outcome, something not every sees under the hood.
        </li>
    </ol>


    <!-- Impressions Section -->

    <h2>Impressions</h2>

    <p>
        Even though I read this like a day after starting my website, I learned about so many fundamentals in order to
        maintain it and how to connect with people through my interests. Austin Kleon explains how putting yourself out
        there on the internet can change your life, as showing off what you are doing opens up opportunity for others to
        get involved. By "work" he means current projects, hobbies and overall passions that some others may resonate
        with. No one cares about your latte, post stuff that REAL people will benefit from. The more we put ourselves
        out there on the internet, the more people we meet that could change our life.
        <br>
        <br>
        He also explains that you shouldn't expect a ton of people to come to you after saying "hey I have this blog go
        check it out its good". Be ENGAGING in those communities, be a good citizen of them and be a connector of
        people. Stop expecting others to just follow you or anything when you provide no sense of value.

    <!-- How I Discovered It Mini Section -->

    <h2>How I Discovered It</h2>

    <p>
        I think it was mainly from <a href="https://youtu.be/hv1gOEY3cs4" target="_blank">Ali Abdaal</a> mentioning it a
        thousand times on how it changed his life. Alongside Anything You Want, I saw this book in the same video and
        saw it was less than 100 pages to read. Yeah I sound like some fanboy of him as I mentioned him before but who
        cares, I find value from these books regardless.
    </p>


    <!-- Who Should Read It Mini Section -->

    <h2>Who Should Read It?</h2>

    <p>
        I think that in this day and age we should all be putting ourselves out there, so pretty much everyone who has
        any sort of interest to starting a YouTube channel, website or even a company. But either if you don't have some
        sort of interest in that stuff, you should start becoming the person who's active, as it can really change your
        life and meet some amazing people. Either way, it also has amazing advice on how to just do your own thing and
        be unique. We're all just interested in each other, so might as well join in on that and SHOW YOUR WORK!

    <!-- How The Book Impacted Me Section -->

    <h2>How It Impacted Me</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            I don't really care about others opinions now, they might get to me from time to time, but still realised
            how everyone is facing their own problems.
        </li>
        <li>
            Making an attempt to not waste peoples time. I tend to review what I am about to post and think about if
            anyone would find this useful after reading it (hopefully this book note is for you!).
        </li>
        <li>
            Going to make sure I maintain my website and have it grow with me along my journey. I will engage with my
            audience and provide the best level of quality that I can (message me on <a
                href="https://twitter.com/parsamesgarha" target="_blank">Twitter!</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
            When this website starts doing well, I want to start a newsletter as he mentions how important it is when
            providing insight to your more interested audience, even if its a small update.
        </li>
        <li>
            Now, I know I am getting way too ahead of myself, but the idea of a tip/donation on my page if someone feels
            generous is an idea I like. Not prioritising it of course, but a nice addition if someone wants to give a
            nice gesture. Something like "buy me a coffee" sounds friendly lol.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <!-- Interesting Quotes Section -->

    <h2>Some Quotes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            "The act of sharing is one of generosity—you’re putting something out there because you think it might be
            helpful or entertaining to someone on the other side of the screen."
        </li>
        <li>
            "Build a good name. Keep your name clean. Don’t make compromises. Don’t worry about making a bunch of money
            or being successful. Be concerned with doing good work . . . and if you can build a good name, eventually
            that name will be its own currency.”
        </li>
        <li>
            "Make stuff you love and talk about stuff you love and you’ll attract people who love that kind of stuff.
            It’s that simple."
        </li>
        <li>
            “The trick is not caring what EVERYBODY thinks of you and just caring about what the RIGHT people think of
            you.” —Brian Michael Bendis
        </li>
        <li>
            “Anyone who isn’t embarrassed of who they were last year probably isn’t learning enough,” writes author
            Alain de Botton.
        </li>
        <li>
            "Look for something new to learn, and when you find it, dedicate yourself to learning it out in the open.
            Document your progress and share as you go so that others can learn along with you. Show your work, and when
            the right people show up, pay close attention to them, because they’ll have a lot to show you."
        </li>
