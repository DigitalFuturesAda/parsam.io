        <p>
            Iâ€™m a 17 year old student living in London and currently in my final year of studying Information
            Technology. I
            enjoy programming, learning about entrepreneurship and keeping up to date with tech. Overall, I just love
            technology because of the endless capabilities.

            People think that when you want to change your life, you need to think big. James Clear knows that real
            change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions.

            In 1962, fresh out of business school, Phil Knight borrowed $50 from his father and created a company with a
            simple mission: import high-quality, low-cost athletic shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the boot of
            his Plymouth, Knight grossed $8000 in his first year. Today, Nike's annual sales top $30 billion.
