        Iâ€™m a 17 year old student living in London and currently in my final year of studying Information Technology. I enjoy programming, learning about entrepreneurship and keeping up to date with tech. Overall, I just love technology because of the endless capabilities.

        In between each paragraph, just use those p tags.
        I like writing one sentence per line here.
        But it will all just come out as one paragraph.

        You get used to writing inbetween the tags, and just ignoring them.
        It's so much easier than using a collection of other tools to make HTML.
        Just write inside an HTML file directly!
        So much simpler.
