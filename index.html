        <p>
            Iâ€™m a 17 year old student living in London and currently in my final year of studying Information
            Technology. I
            enjoy programming, learning about entrepreneurship and keeping up to date with tech. Overall, I just love
            technology because of the endless capabilities.

            In between each paragraph, just use those p tags.
            I like writing one sentence per line here.
            But it will all just come out as one paragraph.
        <p>
            You get used to writing inbetween the tags, and just ignoring them.
            It's so much easier than using a collection of other tools to make HTML.
            Just write inside an HTML file directly!
            So much simpler.
