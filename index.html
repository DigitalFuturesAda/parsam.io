        <p>
            Iâ€™m a 17 year old student living in London and currently in my final year of studying Information
            Technology. I
            enjoy programming, learning about entrepreneurship and keeping up to date with tech. Overall, I just love
            technology because of the endless capabilities.

            Show Your Work! is about why generosity trumps genius. It's about getting findable, about using the network
            instead of wasting time networking. It's not self-promotion, it's self-discovery let others into your
            process, then let them steal from you.

            In 1962, fresh out of business school, Phil Knight borrowed $50 from his father and created a company with a
            simple mission: import high-quality, low-cost athletic shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the boot of
            his Plymouth, Knight grossed $8000 in his first year. Today, Nike's annual sales top $30 billion.

            Sivers didn't need a business plan, and neither do you. You don't need to think big; in fact, it's better if
            you don't. Anything You Want will inspire you to start with what you have, care about your customers more
            than yourself, and run your business like you don't need the money.
