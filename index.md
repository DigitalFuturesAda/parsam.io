<h1>Hey, I'm Parsa.</h1>

## Me in 30 seconds (ish)

Iâ€™m a 17 year old from London in my final year of College. I'm really keen on learning more about tech, startups and even deeper topics of life.

My website is where I write notes on various books, providing summaries on them for others to get a rough understanding of what they're about. On top of that, I write articles on topics revolving around living a better life, but also planning on doing more programming related stuff, explaining my projects.

If you're curious to know how this website looks under the hood, check out the repository over on [GitHub](https://github.com/pzrsa/pzrsa.github.io){:target="\_blank"}. I tend to keep my site simple and easy to use, since its much easier to maintain over the long term. My site is hosted on GitHub Pages which is a bonus for my static site.
