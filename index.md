## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Parsa.

I'm an 18 year old based in London. I'm keen on learning deeply about stuff like tech, startups and also living a good life.

I'm an [ex-gamer](https://www.youtube.com/c/prsaa){:target="\_blank"}, which is a surprise to new people I meet, but that was my entire identity for most of my teen life. Either way, I still had some amazing times playing games with my friends. I genuinely don't think I could have been happier spending my time playing Call of Duty (on console) and some other popular games ([on my custom built PC](/assets/images/built-pc.jpeg).)

I spend the majority of my time now developing, mostly within the Python ecosystem. I've started programming at the beginning of 2021 and its completely changed my life. Right now though I'm learning about JavaScript as I find myself to be more interested in that ecosystem of tech.

Anyways, my website is where I write [notes](/notes) on various books, providing summaries and my overall verdict for others to get a rough understanding of what they're about. On top of that, I write [articles](/articles) on topics revolving around living a better life.

If you don't want to miss out on any book notes I publish, subscribe to my [Substack](https://parsamesgarha.substack.com/){:target="\_blank"} so they land straight into your inbox.

## My website

If you're curious to know how this website looks under the hood, check out the repository over on [GitHub](https://github.com/pzrsa/pzrsa.github.io){:target="\_blank"}. I tend to keep my site minimal and easy to navigate, since its much easier to maintain over the long term. My site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="\_blank"}, which is a bonus for my static site.
