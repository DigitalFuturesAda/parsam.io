## Me in 30 seconds (ish)

I'm a 17 year old based in London, and I'm keen on learning deeply on topics like tech, startups and most importantly, living a meaningful life.

I've just finished my final year of college, so I'll be putting more time and effort into writing on my website and also making YouTube videos.

My website is where I write notes on various books, providing summaries on them for others to get a rough understanding of what they're about. On top of that, I write articles on topics revolving around living a better life, but also planning on doing more programming related stuff, like explaining my projects.

If you're curious to know how this website looks under the hood, check out the repository over on [GitHub](https://github.com/pzrsa/pzrsa.github.io){:target="\_blank"}. I tend to keep my site simple and easy to use, since its much easier to maintain over the long term. My site is hosted on GitHub Pages which is a bonus for my static site.
