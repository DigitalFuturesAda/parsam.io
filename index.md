## Me in 15 seconds (ish)

I'm an 18 year old based in London. I'm keen on learning extensively on topics like tech, startups and life.

I've just finished my final year of college, so I'll be putting more time and effort into writing on my website and also making YouTube videos.

I'm currently figuring out what I want to do with my life going forward, especially now that I've turned 18. I might go to university for a degree in CS, or do something entrepreneurial early. Whatever I do, I know it'll be fine and there is nothing to worry about. Its the 21st century and there are millions of paths we can take, which is one thing I've started to notice.

Anyways, my website is where I write [notes](/notes) on various books, providing summaries and my overall verdict for others to get a rough understanding of what they're about. On top of that, I write [articles](/articles) on topics revolving around living a better life, but also planning on doing more programming related stuff, like explaining my projects.

## Miscellaneous stuff

If you're curious to know how this website looks under the hood, check out the repository over on [GitHub](https://github.com/pzrsa/pzrsa.github.io){:target="\_blank"}. I tend to keep my site simple and easy to use, since its much easier to maintain over the long term. My site is hosted on GitHub Pages which is a bonus for my static site.
