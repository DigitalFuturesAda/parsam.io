## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Parsa.

I'm an 18 year old based in London, currently a
**Software Engineer Apprentice at <span style="color: #4285F4">G</span><span style="color: #DB4437">o</span><span style="color: #F4B400">o</span><span style="color: #4285F4">g</span><span style="color: #0F9D58">l</span><span style="color: #DB4437">e</span>**!

Keen on learning deeply about stuff like tech, startups, and life, I tend to spend the majority of my time learning through books, podcasts and other resources online.

<!--
I'm an [ex-gamer](https://www.youtube.com/c/prsaa){:target="\_blank"}, which is a surprise to new people I meet, but that was my entire identity for most of my teen life. Either way, I still had some amazing times playing games with my friends. I genuinely don't think I could have been happier spending my time playing Call of Duty (on console) and some other popular games ([on my custom built PC](/assets/images/built-pc.jpeg).) -->

My website is where I write [notes](/notes) on the books I've read, providing summaries for others to get a rough understanding of what the book is about. On top of that, I write [articles](/articles) which revolve around the topics I'm most interested in. I'm trying my best to improve on making quality posts, so feel free to message me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/parsamesgarha){:target="\_blank"} with any feedback you might have.

Also if you don't want to miss out on any book notes I publish, subscribe to my [Substack](https://parsamesgarha.substack.com/){:target="\_blank"} so they land straight into your inbox.

## My Site

If you're curious to know how this website looks under the hood, check out the repository over on [GitHub](https://github.com/pzrsa/pzrsa.github.io){:target="\_blank"}. I tend to keep my site minimal and easy to navigate, since its much easier to maintain over the long term. My site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="\_blank"}, which is a bonus for my static site.
