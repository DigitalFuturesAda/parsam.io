Its powered by plain HTML5/CSS3 (probably quite obvious), and hosted through GitHub Pages.

I write notes on various books, providing summaries on them for others to get a rough understanding of what they're about.

I'm also planning on writing posts on things like living a better life, money, startups, and programming.

I hope you find my site useful, please check it out at:
