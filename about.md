# About Me

I have a love for tech, startups and becoming a better version of myself. I was a really passionate gamer for almost half of my life, but put an end to that back in August 2020. My life has completely changed and now I do things I never even imagined doing before. Quitting has now unlocked this unseen part of my brain where I now am constantly curious about a lot of cool things.

I'm not very "smart" on paper due to my previous lack of focus in class, but in just a space of 7 months, I consider myself a well rounded human who knows they can accomplish great things in life. I think my background is quite unique since I was never considered the "nerd" in school, but instead the "gamer" which at the time was a nice identity to go by, but it has lowered my chances of getting into a good University.

<!--
However, I was VERY (and I mean VERY) lucky to be accepted into a top 100 University here in the UK, for a degree in Computer Science. I'm not getting a degree because I rely on it or because I want to do a 9-5 job for the rest of my life, but because I want to increase the amount of options I have. A degree can help get my foot into the door for my career. Plus the way student debt is handled here in the UK is different to how it works in the US, so I'm not really concerned about the cost as much as others would in other countries. Yes I'm well aware of the value of the degree decreasing, but I want to also meet like minded people either on campus or an internship I work at. Hopefully when I gain enough experience of how a company operates, I'll aim to own equity in a company through starting my own one, or joining at an early stage startup. -->

Anyways, I don't want to bore you any longer. I'm proud of myself for who I have become, and me just explaining might give some inspiration to show that anyone can set themselves up for a well rounded life. I'm not trying to say I'm successful, but a lot of things I'm doing are the right things to do at my age (what older people have told me who are doing pretty good in life). Its never too late to make a change and its also never too early. I'm well aware of how arrogant I sound whenever I talk about how I'm doing now, but honestly I'm just passionate about it and want to help.

Please message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/parsamesgarha){:target="\_blank"} if you have ANY questions. The best advice I've received was through cold emailing some amazing people like [Derek Sivers](https://twitter.com/sivers){:target="\_blank"}, who literally convinced me to build this website from scratch instead of using a website builder.

I would love to get to know you and also curious to know what you're doing with your life. I can provide some wisdom and also good material for you to take a look at.

Thank you so much for reading this far, it truly means a lot.
