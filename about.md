title: About Me
---

I have a love for tech, startups and becoming a better version of myself. I was a really passionate gamer for almost half of my life, but put an end to that back in August 2020. My life has completely changed and now I do things I never even imagined doing before. Quitting has now unlocked this unseen part of my brain where I now am constantly curious about a lot of cool things.

I'm not very "smart" on paper due to my previous lack of focus in class, but in just a space of 7 months, I consider myself a well rounded human who knows they can accomplish great things in life. I think my background is quite unique since I was never considered the "nerd" in school, but instead the "gamer" which at the time was a nice identity to go by, but it has lowered my chances of getting into a good University.

Anyways, I don't want to bore you any longer. I'm proud of myself for who I have become, and me just explaining might give some inspiration to show that anyone can set themselves up for a well rounded life. I'm not trying to say I'm successful, but a lot of things I'm doing are the right things to do at my age (what older people have told me who are doing pretty good in life). Its never too late to make a change and its also never too early. I'm well aware of how arrogant I sound whenever I talk about how I'm doing now, but honestly I'm just passionate about it and want to help.

Thank you so much for reading this far, it truly means a lot.
